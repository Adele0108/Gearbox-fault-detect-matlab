# Gearbox-fault-detect-matlab
Use SAE to classify the fault of gearbox
# Describe
Through deep learning, deep neural net- works (DNNs) with deep architectures, instead of shallow ones, could be established to mine the useful information from raw data and approximate complex non-linear func- tions. We use the SAE(Stack Autoencoder) to achieve intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery.
# Datasets
Our datasets come from laboratory experiments,which are not very large.
